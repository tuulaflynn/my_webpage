        Hey my name's Tuula I'm really interested in maths, computer science, physics and art.
        For me physical energy is just as important as mental energy so I like to exercise both my body and mind.
        I enjoy martial arts (I'm pictured sparring in the centre of the photo on this page from a training session with
        my university kickboxing team),
        cold water swimming, touch rugby and squash to name but a few.
        By nature I'm competitive which pushes me forward. I wholeheartedly respect the rules and regulations things are
        built upon.
        One of my strengths is my ability to involve myself in new things.
        Last summer I tried kite surfing for the first time and was exhilarated by the whole experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        My inquisitive nature means I always like talking to people.
        I'm friendly open and get on well with people from all walks of life.
    </p>

        From a young age I've love discovering new places, recently I spent half a year travelling around Colombia.
        I took optional Spanish classes at university to develop my lingustic skills and it was rewarding to impove and
        see the progress I have made.
        It meant I was able to immerse myself better in the wonderful Colombian culture. I made many Colombian friends
        who I am excited to revisit one day.

    <ul>
        <li>Python program called Inventory, which used object-orietation to optimise stock-takes for Nike warehouses

                    for project</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Python program called Garden, which uses NLP (natural language processsing) to try and process garden-path
            sentences</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/tuulaflynn/Task-37#readme" target="_blank">The README.md for project

                    for project</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Python program called watch_next which uses NLP to suggest a movie for the user to watch next.
            It makes this suggestion by selecting a movie from the database whose plot is most similar to the plot of
            the movie last seen.</li>
